# Authentication with NextAuth.js

## Overview

Welcome to the world of modern authentication powered by NextAuth.js! In this guide, we'll introduce you to the concept of password-less authentication and how NextAuth.js can seamlessly help you achieve your authentication goals.

## Why NextAuth.js?

At the heart of our authentication philosophy lies the idea of password-less authentication. We firmly believe that this approach enhances security and user experience. To bring this vision to life, we've chosen NextAuth.js as our go-to authentication library. Its robust features and flexibility align perfectly with our mission.

## Getting Started

We've successfully implemented authentication using NextAuth.js, ensuring a secure and smooth user authentication process for our application.

To demonstrate the capabilities of NextAuth.js, we've focused on two of the most widely used authentication methods:

1. **[Credentials Provider](/docs/guide/authentication/credentials-provider)** - The Credentials Provider method allows users to authenticate using traditional credentials like usernames and passwords. This is a fundamental authentication approach and is often used as a starting point for many applications.

2. **[Google Provider and Prisma Adapter](/docs/guide/authentication/google-prisma)** - For those who prefer a more integrated approach, we've also integrated the Google Provider along with the Prisma Adapter. This offers users the convenience of signing in with their Google accounts while leveraging the power of Prisma for data management.

## What's Next?

As you dive deeper into our documentation, you'll find comprehensive guides on setting up and configuring both of these authentication methods. Whether you're interested in the straightforward approach of the Credentials Provider or the combined prowess of Google Provider and Prisma Adapter, we've got you covered.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt these methods to match your application's authentication needs. Let's empower your users with secure and hassle-free authentication using NextAuth.js!

Happy authenticating! 🛡️🔐
