# Demo Configs

We provide a `demo-configs` folder with demo files of the configurations we use in our demos.

You can use these files to get the configurations like our demos.

All you have to do is copy the demo file content you like from the `demo-configs` folder and paste it into the `src/configs/themeConfig.ts` file.

**Please Note**: Some of the configurations are stored in `sessionStorage` & `cookie` hence, you'll have to clear the application data in your browser like shown in the below image and refresh the page.
